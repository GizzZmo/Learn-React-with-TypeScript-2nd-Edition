# Quick Start Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with the code examples from "Learn React with TypeScript - Second Edition" as quickly as possible.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16.0.0 or later)
  - Check version: `node --version`
  - Download from: https://nodejs.org/

- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
  - Check version: `npm --version`

- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
  - Check version: `git --version`
  - Download from: https://git-scm.com/

- **Code Editor** (VS Code recommended)
  - Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GizzZmo/Learn-React-with-TypeScript-2nd-Edition.git
cd Learn-React-with-TypeScript-2nd-Edition
```

### 2. Choose Your Chapter

The repository is organized by chapters. Each chapter contains specific examples:

```
Learn-React-with-TypeScript-2nd-Edition/
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter1/   # React Basics
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter2/   # TypeScript Fundamentals
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter3/   # Project Setup
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter4/   # React Hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter5/   # Styling
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter6/   # React Router
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter7/   # Forms
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter8/   # State Management
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter9/   # REST APIs
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter10/  # GraphQL APIs
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter11/  # Reusable Components
â””â”€â”€ Chapter12/  # Testing
```

## Running Your First Example

Let's run a complete React application from Chapter 4:

### Step 1: Navigate to the Example

```bash
cd Chapter4/Section1-Using-the-effect-hook
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will download all required packages. It may take a few minutes the first time.

### Step 3: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The application will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 4: Make Changes

Try editing the source files in the `src/` directory. The page will automatically reload when you save changes.

### Step 5: Stop the Server

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the development server.

## Common Commands

Once you're in an example directory with a `package.json` file:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm install` | Install all dependencies |
| `npm start` | Start development server |
| `npm test` | Run tests (if available) |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run lint` | Check code style (if configured) |

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is already in use, you'll see an error. Either:
- Stop the other application using port 3000
- Choose a different port when prompted (type `y` and press Enter)

### Module Not Found Errors

If you see "Module not found" errors:
1. Delete `node_modules` folder: `rm -rf node_modules`
2. Delete `package-lock.json`: `rm package-lock.json`
3. Reinstall: `npm install`

### TypeScript Errors

If you see TypeScript errors when running examples:
1. Make sure you're in the correct directory
2. Check that `node_modules` is installed
3. Try restarting the development server

### Slow Installation

If `npm install` is slow:
- Make sure you have a good internet connection
- Try using a different npm registry
- Consider using `yarn` instead: `yarn install`

## VS Code Tips

If you're using VS Code:

### Recommended Extensions

Install these extensions for the best experience:
- **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets**: Code snippets
- **Prettier**: Code formatter
- **ESLint**: Code linting
- **TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)**: Better TypeScript support

### Open Multiple Examples

You can open multiple examples in VS Code workspaces:
1. File â†’ Add Folder to Workspace
2. Select each example folder you want to work with
3. File â†’ Save Workspace As

### Integrated Terminal

Use VS Code's integrated terminal:
- View â†’ Terminal (or `` Ctrl+` ``)
- You can have multiple terminals open for different examples
