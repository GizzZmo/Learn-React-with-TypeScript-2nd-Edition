* Gain first-hand experience of TypeScript and its productivity features
* Understand how to transpile your TypeScript code into JavaScript for running in a browser
* Build a React frontend codebase with hooks
* Interact with REST and GraphQL web APIs
* Design and develop strongly typed reusable components
* Create automated component tests
